# Layers

To manage size and complexity, many applications have long used a so-called N-tier model. 

**1. Web Layer:**

* **Role:** The entry point for client requests and the exit point for server responses.
* **Functionality:** Handles incoming HTTP requests, assembles them into appropriate data structures, passes them to the Service Layer for processing, and formats the responses before sending them back to the client.
* **Components:** Typically includes controllers or handlers responsible for managing HTTP requests and responses, as well as components for input validation, output formatting, and error handling.

**2. Service Layer:**

* **Role:** The core of the application's business logic.
* **Functionality:** Contains the logic that defines how the application behaves and interacts with data. It coordinates the flow of data between the Web Layer and the Data Layer, performs calculations, and implements business rules.
* **Components:** Typically includes services, components, or modules that encapsulate specific business functionalities.

**3. Data Layer:**

* **Role:** Responsible for interacting with data stores and other services.
* **Functionality:** Handles data retrieval, storage, and manipulation. It abstracts away the details of data storage and retrieval, making the application more modular and easier to maintain.
* **Components:** Typically includes data access objects (DAOs), repositories, or database connectors that provide methods for interacting with databases or other data sources.

**4. Model Layer:**

* **Role:** Defines the structure and relationships between data elements.
* **Functionality:** Provides a shared representation of data that can be used by all layers of the application. It ensures consistency and avoids redundancy in data definitions.
* **Components:** Typically includes classes or structures that represent data entities, along with their attributes and relationships.

**5. Web Client:**

* **Role:** The user interface that interacts with the web application.
* **Functionality:** Sends HTTP requests to the server and displays the responses. It can be a web browser, a mobile app, or other client-side software.
* **Components:** Typically includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies used to create the user interface and handle client-side interactions.

**Relationship Between the Layers:**

* **Web Layer:** Receives requests from the Web Client, passes them to the Service Layer, and returns responses to the Web Client.
* **Service Layer:** Processes requests from the Web Layer, calls methods in the Data Layer to access or manipulate data, and returns results to the Web Layer.
* **Data Layer:** Interacts with data stores to retrieve or store data as requested by the Service Layer.
* **Model Layer:** Defines the structure of data used by the Service Layer and Data Layer.

By separating the application into these layers, you can improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability. Each layer can be developed and tested independently, making it easier to manage and update the application over time.
